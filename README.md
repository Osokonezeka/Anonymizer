# *Anonymizer / Pseudonymizer*

***

<a name="why"></a>
## Differences:

##### *Anonymization*
 - is the **IRREVERSIBLE** process of rendering personal data

##### *Pseudonymization*
 - is the process of replacing personal data with random codes, which **CAN BE** linked back to the original person

***

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to:
* generate an `file_to_anonymize.csv` file filled with data ***(Name, Surname, PESEL, Age)*** generated by `create_and_fill_csv_file()` function
* import data from `file_to_anonymize.csv` file
* [anonymize and pseudoanonymize imported data](#why)
* export data to files named `anonymized_file.csv` and `pseudoanonymized_file.csv`
* revert pseudoanonymization and export it to `reverted_file.csv`


> [!NOTE]
> Files name can be changed in the `file_anonymizer/create_anonymized_file.py` by changing ```name_of_file_to_write``` property
