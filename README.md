# *Anonymizer / Pseudonymizer*

***

## Differences:

##### *Anonymization*
 - is the **IRREVERSIBLE** process of rendering personal data

##### *Pseudonymization*
 - is the process of replacing personal data with random codes, which **CAN BE** linked back to the original person

***

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to:
* generate an ```file_to_anonymize.csv``` file filled with data ***(Name, Surname, PESEL, Age)*** generated by ```create_and_fill_csv_file()``` function
* import data from ```file_to_anonymize.csv``` file
* anonymize and pseudoanonymize imported data
* export data to files named ```anonymized_file.csv``` and ```pseudoanonymized_file.csv```
* revert pseudoanonymization and export it to ```reverted_file.csv```


> [!NOTE]
> Files name can be changed in the ```file_anonymizer/create_anonymized_file.py``` by changing ```name_of_file_to_write``` property
